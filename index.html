        To reach a port, we must sail
        sail, not tie at anchor
        sail, not drift.

        Why am I doing this?  I have three passions that are my driving force to answer why.  I have a passion for creating a process.  I obtain a unique satisfaction when I create a process or best practice.  I have created processes that have literally effected company polices worldwide.  I strive to find innovative best practices that have both short term and long term affects.  I have a passion for creativity.  I am a musician.  I find that creativity connects with our inner self and can provide satisfaction, problem solving, and joy in our lives.  I have a passion for entrepreneurial endeavors.  I enjoy being scrappy and figuring out how to complete a task that is over my head.  Again, this passion brings me a unique joy and satisfaction of a job well done.  It is my belief that if you donâ€™t have the passion or drive, your potential is stymied.
